Makers initiate transfers, which then appear on the 'Approve' screen for Approvers to review and either approve or reject. This system distributes responsibilities and enhances accountability in managing settlements.\n\nYou can track status by visiting the Transactions screen of your Ramp platform. For any prefunding or asset transaction, including stablecoins, there are dedicated entries to help you reconcile and track efficiently. Our multi-currency payments system helps you check  status across different currencies easily.\n\nTransfers to incorrect account details fail instantly once initiated. For certain banks, it may take up to 24 hours to receive a confirmation of failure.\n\nWith Webhooks, you can automatically receive updates on payment statuses. Set up a webhook to monitor events like status changes in payments, including stablecoins, which can be triggered by your requests, processed both synchronously and asynchronously. While most updates are immediate, some payment methods may take longer. TransFi will notify you as soon as the bank confirms the payment status.\n\nReady to start yourTransFi journey?",

It stands out through its integration with Circle, a trusted provider of digital financial infrastructure. Each time a fiat payment is made, TransFi automatically creates a dedicated Circle wallet, ensuring enterprise-grade security and full regulatory compliance. The wallet supports real-time conversion into USDC, a fully backed and transparent stablecoin, providing a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. Whether managing treasury operations, funding a gaming account, or executing global payouts, TransFi Wallet gives complete borderless control over funds from a single, intuitive platform.\n\nTransFi Wallet offers a simple yet powerful user journey. It begins when a payment is initiated through a supported local fiat method, such as UPI, bank transfer, card, or other regional options. Upon receipt of the fiat, TransFi automatically creates a secure Circle wallet to process and store the equivalent value in USDC. The process is fully automated, requiring no manual setup or technical intervention. Once the Circle wallet is funded, TransFi, with user authorization, transfers the funds to the intended destination, whether a merchant account, gaming platform, or other payout, completing the transaction instantly. This flow reduces friction in cross-border payments, converting fiat into digital dollars for immediate global use\n\nTransFi Wallet supports over 40 fiat currencies and more than 80 crypto tokens, including leading stablecoins such as USDC.

This wide-ranging integration eliminates common barriers to stablecoin and crypto access, making on-ramps from emerging markets fast, reliable, and accessible.\n\nTransFi Wallet is more than a top-up tool.

Users can receive, store, monitor, and transfer assets independently of top-up activities. This dual functionality supports continuous payouts, treasury management, and broader financial operations for both individuals and enterprises.\n\nTransparency is a core feature of TransFi Wallet. Every transaction provides real-time status updates, ensuring full visibility at every stage, from processing and conversion to final transfer. This clarity is essential for high-stakes operations such as treasury management or bulk payouts, where timing, accuracy, and accountability are critical.\n\nTransFi Wallet is designed for flexibility and is fully white-labeled and API-first. Businesses can integrate it into existing systems and brand it as their own, providing a consistent and professional experience for users. Unlike platforms that require complex developer setups or offer limited customization, TransFi Wallet is adaptable, easy to implement, and robust enough to support a wide range of business models.\n\nMany wallets on the market are restricted to crypto-only transactions or lack integration with fiat payment rails, limiting their utility for real-world financial operations.

Integration with TransFi’s global payouts infrastructure enables businesses to both collect and distribute funds using the same stack, eliminating the need for multiple tools and streamlining operations for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nSecurity is a core principle of the TransFi Wallet. The wallet infrastructure is backed by Circle, a globally recognized leader in digital finance with strict regulatory compliance. Funds are managed in an environment prioritizing transparency, compliance, and safety. Wallet permissions are fully controlled by the user, transfers occur only with explicit consent, and every action is logged and auditable for complete traceability\n\nTransFi Wallet is built for anyone moving money across borders with speed and efficiency. Whether managing contractor payouts, processing user top-ups, or overseeing treasury operations, the wallet provides a comprehensive toolkit for handling both digital assets and fiat. It empowers businesses and individuals to operate in a compliant, cost-effective, and highly functional environment, bridging traditional finance and the digital economy.\n\nReady to start yourTransFi journey?",
